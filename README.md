# roblox-friend-bot

this sends a friend request to eveyrone in the roblox employee group

i scraped the group and put it in to a database so its offline and i wont update it bcuz i dont want many ppl to use this making it less effective

just extract the zip and run main.py

if it breaks, which it will, it saves every ID into a file so u dont have to send requests to the same ppl when u re-run

i dont know the rate-limit so it just sends a request every 10 seconds, even then i get rate limited with this and often get token errors

expect to restart the program every 10 minutes, took me about 4 days to clear through 2100 requests. never planned on releasing it

i wont fix it ever
